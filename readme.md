Hello! My name is Tristan!

I am experienced in Python, which I have used to make multiple games using the pygame library (some of which remain unfinished), HTML CSS and Javascript which I have used to create websites, Java which I have used to make Minecraft serverside plugins, and with OnBot Java on an FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) team, and finally C# which I have used with the Unity game engine to create some video games (see my itch.io)
