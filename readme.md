Hello! My name is Tristan!

I am experienced in Python, which I have used to make multiple games using the pygame library (some of which remain unfinished). I have also used HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which I have used to create multiple websites. In addition I am also experienced in Java, which I have used to make Minecraft server-side plugins, and scripts for an FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) team that I am a part of. I have also worked with C# (in the Unity game engine) to create multiple video games (see my itch.io).
